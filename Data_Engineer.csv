Same thing with brands. And when the two combine… magic!

Penta isn’t like any other hotel you know. Difference drives us, in every corner of the hotel, in everything we say. Not difference for the sake of it, but because we recognise that this is what our customers – Pentapeople – truly want.

Take the Pentalounge. It redefines what a hotel lobby can be: fun, friendly, relaxed. A cocktail when you check in, a game of billiards, a heartfelt friendly greeting. When people connect with us, they come back for more. And we make sure we’re relaxed and open, because it makes our guests (even people like Brad Pitt) feel relaxed too. We wear jeans and talk to each other like friends would, all the way up to the managing director . We are Team Penta!

Got what it takes to join the team



You monitor the preventive maintenance and repairs on the hotel guestrooms and power plant machinery to keep facilities in an operable and efficient condition at all time.

You will be the master of all technology, and will have a wide area of responsibility. Of course you won't find life boring when working for us, as everyday you can demonstrate your new ideas and skills. For this, on your days off you can stay at unbeatable rates in our lifestyle hotels - and see how the lights flash there.

Ready to join Penta?

Have you already had six years with a hotel and known what it looks like in the cellar, on the roof, and behind the scenes?

Have you learned electrical engineering or heating technology from the bottom to the top?

Are you a Registered Electrical Worker A(0)?

Do you enjoy fiddling around, tinkering and repairing, and always find a practical solution?

Can you be relied upon 100%?

Do you enjoy 5-day work week and feel happy working in a really cool environment?

Please email us at [email redacted, apply via Company website] or fax us on 3112 8230 with your cover letter and CV specifying your job title, present and expected salary.

We value diversity — in backgrounds and in experiences. Healthcare is a universal concern, and we need people from all backgrounds and swaths of life to help build the future of healthcare. Clover's engineering team is empathetic, caring, and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of engineering team and culture that we are building, seeking engineers that are not only strong in their own aptitudes but care deeply about supporting each other's growth.

We are looking for software engineers that want to solve many different kinds of problems. You will work with other engineers, data scientists, and healthcare professionals building tools to improve the health of real people.

As a Staff Software Engineer, you will:
Commit to simplifying the complexities of healthcare by building systems that multiply human efforts.

Be a pragmatic voice, collaborating across multiple teams and areas of concern.

Dig into projects in order to build robust and easy to use APIs.

Learn about new tools and technologies to solve problems and move our goals forward.

Help the team define and maintain development practices that let us iterate quickly while maintaining quality — including writing tests and documenting key implementations.

Mentor people around you, helping the entire team level up in skills.


You are excited by big, complicated problems and try to solve them with pragmatic, well-engineered solutions. You have a natural intellectual curiosity that drives you to find out how things work and if they can work better.

You enjoy working in a fluid, collaborative environment, defining and owning priorities that adapt to our larger goals. You can bring clarity to ambiguity while remaining open-minded to new information that might change your mind.

You are not hesitant to jump in to help fix things that are broken and you feel great responsibility to make sustainable systems. You are happy to fill in the gaps to reach a goal where necessary, even if it does not always fit your job description.

You have a genuine interest in what good technology can do to help people and have a positive attitude about tackling hard problems in an important industry.


You have experience with functional or imperative programming languages -- e.g., Python, Ruby, Go, C, or Java.

You approach building and maintaining systems with maturity and rigor.

You have scaled the impact of other engineers through mentorship, development of reusable libraries, and documentation.

You are able to work in different technical systems and concerns.

You have lead development projects, but have also value created space and opportunity for other people to become leaders.

You have both built and refactored complex (often distributed) systems.

Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. We are an E-Verify company.

We are reinventing health insurance by combining the power of data with human empathy to keep our members healthier. We believe the healthcare system is broken, so we've created custom software and analytics to empower our clinical staff to intervene and provide personalized care to the people who need it most.

We always put our members first, and our success as a team is measured by the quality of life of the people we serve. Those who work at Clover are passionate and mission-driven individuals with diverse areas of expertise, working together to solve the most complicated problem in the world: healthcare.

From Clover's inception, Diversity & Inclusion have always been key to our success. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and our employees are people with different strengths, experiences and backgrounds, who share a passion for improving people's lives. Diversity not only includes race and gender identity, but also age, disability status, veteran status, sexual orientation, religion and many other parts of one's identity. All of our employee's points of view are key to our success, and inclusion is everyone's responsibility.

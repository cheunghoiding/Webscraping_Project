Salary won’t buy your employees’ happiness!

### Findings and suggestion in terms of company’s score & salary
Overall Score is the average of the scores below:
1. Compensation & Benefits
2. Culture & Values
3. Career Opportunities
4. Work/Life Balance
5. Senior Management

For middle-size companies:
- They pay the lowest salary and score the lowest overall score from employees
- Given no obvious correlation between salary and overall score, our suggestions for them in order to improve the above-mentioned factors to gain higher score from employees are:
  - Retain talents in the company
  - Reduce the turnover cost

## Challenges & Next Steps
1. Data Availability
  - Challenges: Out of 1,022 scraped job postings, only 35.2% of them have salary information
  - Next Steps: Use a more reliable resource with particular emphasis on salary data, e.g. Payscale

2. Static Analysis
  - Challenges: The analysis is conducted based on particular data that was extracted in one single timeframe, that is 20 June 2021 afternoon.
  - Next Steps: Apply automation / machine-centred operation to enable real-time tracking, perhaps machine learning

3. Incomplete Data
  - Challenges: Not enough information regarding required experience level for each job, hard to analyse correlation between experience level & mean salary
  - Next Steps: Likely apply machine learning to more accurately classify job category and seniority of each posting
